# Pole-Consensus-in-Blockchain-and-optimal-compute-resource-trading
This project implements a **Python-based simulation** of a blockchain framework that integrates **Proof of Learning (PoLe)** as a consensus mechanism for **neural network training** while optimizing **resource distribution** using a **Stackelberg game model**. The simulation demonstrates how computational resources are allocated dynamically for training and validation tasks. The **Stackelberg model** ensures **optimal resource distribution** among competing nodes. The **original paper referenced in the repository** first proposed the idea, and our implementation builds upon it. For a **detailed description**, refer to the **report**. The results show **efficient resource allocation, enhanced security**, and **dynamic pricing strategies**, with future work focusing on **scalability and real-time data integration**. ðŸš€
